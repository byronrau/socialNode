On Wednesday, in a quiet corner of Arlington National Cemetery, the Army made its recognition permanent, allowing Mrs. Harmon’s remains to be laid to rest at last with full military honors alongside her fellow veterans.

Mrs. Harmon, who died in April 2015 at age 95, had been a member of the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs, a first-of-its-kind Army unit made up of women who flew planes and trained men to do the same during World War II.\"",

Someone in an office somewhere called me and notified me that the next day would end my ability to appeal- and they told me they we calling because they felt it was wrong. I asked why my claim was denied in the first place?! They told me because I didn't show up to appointments... Appointments they never notified me of, and immediately denied the claim. They didn't try and reschedule or anything. The VA had my address and phone number. I made sure it was all updated. It was a deliberate attempt to deny my claim.
I have a claim for MST. There was a rape kit performed, CID investigated and I was granted a compassionate reassignment back stateside (stationed in Germany). I've asked repeatedly what exactly the appointments are for, given I've proven that the events happened already. The response was \"to ensure that it has actually had an impact on you\" and that \"there are some veterans who have had much worse happen, it's not like you lost a limb\".
THAT is what the VA does to veterans, especially female veterans. We aren't treated the same while serving, and we definitely won't be treated fairly when we are out. How many female veterans are awaiting recognition for MST cases? How many have to prove that being raped \"truly affected them\"? How many are being told that the dramatic change in the course of their lives, their nightmares and their fear- isn't as bad as losing a limb? How many of these women are mothers, trying to keep their pain hidden in order to keep it from their children? How many of these women are unable to go back to school, working minimum wage jobs because of the problems with social injustice for women, especially those with children?
Why is it that after I waited until 2012, had to quickly file an appeal for a claim I didn't know was denied, and finally got an appointment that I attended- I was quoted with having to wait 8 MORE YEARS for an answer. That answer- is just the VA saying \"yes it happened, and yeah we think it probably affected you for life\". Why is it that I was offered a \"cure for PTSD\" at my last mental health appointment?! BECAUSE THE VA DOESN'T WANT TO APPROVE CLAIMS. AND THE VA DOESN'T THINK THAT RAPE IS TRAUMATIC.",

The researchers also found that men were \"policing the boundaries of gender in the military context,\" and since men still hold most of the leadership positions, they had the opportunity to reinforce gender inequality. For example, women were frequently being left out of the Special Forces, since men were usually the ones deciding who to accept.\"",

They know about the physiological differences and capabilities between men and women, despite the current leaders, feminists and politicians rhetoric that females can do anything males can do. Women are smart enough to anticipate the problems, spoken and unspoken, that are being ignored for the sake of political correctness. And most female NCOs know too much about the life and requirements of combat arms jobs to volunteer for combat arms MOS reclassification. They have already met with success in their current MOS and would run the risk of ruining their careers by switching to a combat arms job where they would be at a huge disadvantage in physical capabilities (strength, endurance, weight bearing differences, etc. of women compared to the testosterone fueled physiological abilities of males), and in years of MOS experience they missed out on, and in credibility with any combat arms males in the units they would be assigned to. Do not expect many clear thinking female soldiers and/or NCOs in their right minds to volunteer for all that.",

We brought them food, ammo, transportation, and hauled them and their shit around everywhere. When the announcement was made that women would be allowee into combat MOS's I watched a 1SG drop the SSG that told him about it because he was so pissed. The attitude comes from the top down in these combat MOS's. I fear that things will not change anytime soon. It did not get better when I was reasigned to a line company right before I left the service.

Honor Flight is an organization that provides trips to the nation's capital at no cost to veterans of World War II, the Korean and Vietnam wars. During each trip to Washington, veterans have the chance to visit their respective war memorials. Bill Richards, director emeritus of Honor Flight Columbus, said the Columbus chapter borrowed the idea from Honor Flight Tri-State in Cincinnati.

'Hosting a flight just for women veterans is a great opportunity to give them the honor they are due for their service,' Richards said. He noted that many women who served in the military during World War II, Korea and Vietnam did not always receive respect from their male counterparts. Additionally, the military of that era was not accommodating to women, with many being issued men's boots and uniforms.\"",

A female aviator asked the head of naval aviation, \"When will women be allowed to fly in combat?\" Jeers filled the auditorium.

Vice Adm. Richard Dunleavy answered, \"If Congress directs the secretary of the Navy to allow women to fly combat aircraft, the Navy will comply.\"

Judging by noise that followed, that didn't sit well with the audience. A male junior officer told the admiral, \"Your answer was not what the vast majority of naval aviators expected or wanted.\" Combat, he said, was \"a male-only domain.\" He took his seat, to thunderous applause.

When the noise finally subsided, the admiral repeated his initial response.\"",

Director Julie Acton stated, “Every year it is a great honor to present these certificates to our Oldest Armed Forces Veteran’s. We want our veterans to know we are grateful for their service, and it is particularly special to have the opportunity to honor someone who served 73 years ago in World War II. Every individual has a story and I am glad we were able to honor Mrs. Coleman for heroism in our country’s history.”'",

The staff sergeant attended the 75th Ranger Regiment’s Ranger Assessment and Selection Program 2 in June, officials said.

RASP 2 is designed for soldiers in the rank of staff sergeant and above and all officers volunteering for assignment to the elite regiment.

“The female soldier did not meet performance objectives required for assignment to the 75th Ranger Regiment,” said Lt. Col. Robert Bockholt, a spokesman for U.S. Army Special Operations Command. “The female soldier has been afforded the opportunity to reapply for RASP 2 beginning December 2016.”'",

Feeling \"tremendously guilty\" that she was the only mom in the Cleveland neighborhood where she lived leaving for work in the morning and that she left the office each day \"with all of the lieutenants still there,\" she wrote a letter asking if she could leave active duty for \"a while\" with the promise of returning later.\"",

What a joke.

Why do you care?? News flash! Youre not MEN! And no matter how hard you try to make everything equal (by tilting the tables to your agenda) we'll never be equal. Why? Because we're different!

Young women are the fastest-growing segment of those treated here, and that's why the VA is opening a new Women's Treatment Center.

\"We're trying to make it as easy and as fabulous as possible for our female veterans to come to the VA and get great care,\" said Dr. Rola Elserag, the hospital's program director for women's health.

It may be new, but veterans like these soon-to-be moms are already seeing the difference.

\"Since the advent of the women's health clinic it's just easier for us to go in there, and they have people who actually relate to our issues. So it's great, \" said Adrian Rideau, an Army veteran and mother of three.\"",

Electrical engineering is a field that some might find intimidating, but as a former Marine, Elizabeth Jones doesn't let her fears get the best of her. Her instructor, Dr. Bhuveneswari Ramachandran, says from day one, she's been a motivated leader and a real go-getter.

Dr. Ramachandran was proud to recommend Elizabeth for the $10,000 scholarship from Google and the Student Veterans of America. She found Elizabeth's determination set her apart from other students.\"",

Walkers and wheelchairs be damned. These WACs (Army), WAVES (Navy) and Marines stood up for their country. Just like they did decades ago when the country needed them most.

Twenty-five or so of these veterans gathered Friday for a first-time Women of Honor Recognition Ceremony in the Hall of Heroes at Kansas City VA Medical Center.

It didn’t take long to see that spunk doesn’t go bad.

Each of the veterans was given a corsage on arrival for Friday’s ceremony. They were happy and proud. They saw a friend in a stranger’s face. Later, as family members watched, the names were called and each veteran was recognized for her service with a certificate and pin.\"",
